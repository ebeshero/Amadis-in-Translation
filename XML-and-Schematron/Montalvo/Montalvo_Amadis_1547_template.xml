                <p> We have used the text of the <bibl>1547 <title>Amadís</title> (Sevilla: Jacopo
                        Cromberberger)</bibl> from which Southey translated. Images of the 1547 are
                    from the Biblioteca Virtual de Andalucía. This text is very similar to the text
                    of the first extant <bibl>
                        <title>Amadís</title>, the 1508 Jorge Coci edition</bibl>, upon which most
                    modern editions are based. Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, a regidor or civic
                    official of the city of Medina del Campo, edited and compiled the version of
                    Amadís we know today from one or more medieval originals. The medieval material
                    is concentrated in Books I-III, with occasional asides from the author. Book IV
                    and the prologues are original to Montalvo. Only one fragment of a medieval
                    Amadís exists, but the first texts are thought to be based in part on the
                    Lancelot material in France and likely appeared in Spain in the mid-fourteenth
                    century. Evidence in the form of character names and references in poetry dates
                    to the fourteenth century. The primitive or medieval Amadís is now thought to be
                    Castilian and not Portuguese or French. The attribution to Portuguese knight
                    Vasco de Lobeira is now known to be apocryphal.<ptr

                <p>This digital critical edition seeks to reproduce the reading experience of the
                        <bibl>1547 <title>Amadís de Gaula</title> (Sevilla: Cromberger)</bibl> with
                    which Robert Southey worked for his translation in order to facilitate
                    comparisons. The following modifications have been made to the 1547 print
                    edition. <list rend="numbered">
                        <item>We employ the letters <hi>i/e/u/y/j</hi> as in modern Spanish: i/e/u
                            express vowel sounds and <hi>y/j</hi> express consonants. For example,
                                <mentioned>reyna</mentioned> in the 1547 has been transcribed as
                                <mentioned>reina</mentioned> and <mentioned>cauallero</mentioned> as
                                <mentioned>cavallero</mentioned>. The letter <hi>y</hi> has vocalic
                            value only at the ends of words, as in <mentioned>muy</mentioned> and
                                <mentioned>rey</mentioned>, and as the conjunction meaning
                                <gloss>and</gloss>.</item>
                        <item>We preserve most of the consonant use of the 1547, including the
                            alternation of <hi>b/v</hi> and <hi>m/n</hi> before <hi>b/p</hi> as well
                            as the absence or presence of <hi>h</hi>. We normalize the use of
                                <hi>qu</hi>.</item>
                        <item>Doubled consonants, <hi>bb</hi>, <hi>cc</hi>, <hi>ff</hi>, etc. are
                            resolved as single except where they have phonetic value.</item>
                        <item>The single <hi>r</hi> and not <hi>rr</hi> has been transcribed after
                            consonants: <mentioned>honrra</mentioned> becomes
                                <mentioned>honra</mentioned>. In some cases the <hi>rr</hi> has been
                            supplied for <hi>r</hi> for phonetic reasons:
                                <mentioned>tiera</mentioned> becomes
                            <mentioned>tierra</mentioned>.</item>
                        <item>We resolve the few abbreviations in the 1547 without alerting the
                            reader. For example, <mentioned>q̃</mentioned> has been resolved as
                                <mentioned>que</mentioned> and <mentioned>scta</mentioned> as
                                <mentioned>sancta</mentioned>. Any ambiguities in abbreviations are
                            tagged.</item>
                        <item>We transcribe the tironian sign as <mentioned>y</mentioned>.</item>
                        <item>We use accentuation according to the norms of modern Spanish in order
                            to guide the reader’s pronunciation and to disambiguate words.</item>
                        <item>We use capital and lower-case letters as in modern Spanish in order to
                            clearly mark proper names and the boundaries of sentence-like
                            groups.</item>
                        <item>We normalize the union and separation of words according to modern
                            Spanish usage.</item>
                        <item>We preserve the punctuation of the 1547 in order to facilitate
                            clause-by-clause comparisons with Southey’s translation. We preserve the
                            1547’s clause-like units (the space between successive punctuation
                            marks) even though we recognize significant differences from modern
                            usage. The 1547 uses <hi>. : /</hi> and infrequent <hi>?</hi> as
                            punctuation, and while sentence-like groups end with a period, the
                            period <hi>.</hi> is also used within sentence-like groups to introduce
                            dialogue. The punctuation marks <hi>:</hi> and <hi>/</hi> appear to
                            freely alternate. We reproduce <hi>. : /</hi> as they appear in the 1547
                            without modernization. We have not added modern <hi>¿?</hi> to mark
                            questions. We do not mark dialogue with em dash; rather, for this
                            digital edition, dialogue, including questions, has been coded in the
                            milestone element. We do not preserve the <hi>//</hi> that indicates
                            line breaks in the middle of words. Our goal in these punctuation
                            decisions is to render structural elements of the text at the sentence
                            and clause level as Southey would have confronted them in order to
                            elucidate whether the 1547 structure and punctuation influenced Southey
                            in his own construction of sentences and clauses, which we observe
                            differs from standard English use.</item>
                        <item>Obvious printer errors have been tagged with the sic element.
                            Corrections are provided based on <bibl>Juan Manuel Cacho Blecua’s
                                critical edition (Madrid: Cátedra, 1999)</bibl>, which takes into
                            consideration multiple sixteenth-century editions of <title>Amadís de
                                Gaula</title> including the <bibl>Sevilla 1526</bibl> on which the
                                <bibl>Sevilla 1547</bibl> is based.</item>
