               so we'll have to make each chapter be a single long paragraph in Montalvo. 
               We'll use the <milestone/> element in the Southey text to indicate his imposed paragraph breaks within that.
            A <milestone/> element appears at the beginning of each of Southey's paragraphs.
            -->
            <!--ebb: 2015-08-20: I'm now rethinking this use of milestone, since we've discovered occasional paragraph breaks within chapters in Montalvo. I'm just going to wrap paragraphs in the <p> element the way the TEI intended! 
                  Perhaps the <s> elements and <cl> elements don't really need to be sitting in the same hierarchical positions in the file anyway, since we are using <milestone/> markers to stitch the Southey together with units of the Montalvo text.-->
