            <p><s>As this Damsel was of quick mind herself, and now guided by the grace of God, she determined to have the remedy ready before the need; and it was in this guise: she took four boards and with them made an ark large enough to contain a new born child and its garments, and long enough for the sword, she fastened them together with bitumen in such sort, as the water should have no place to enter.</s><s>She hid all this under her bed till she had compleated it; and it was even and close as if a master had made it.</s><s>Then she showed it to Elisena and asked for what she thought it was designed?</s><s>She answered, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Helisena"/>I know not.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s><milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Darioleta"/>You shall know,<milestone unit="said" ana="intStart"/> said the Damsel, <milestone unit="said" ana="intEnd"/>when need is.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s>Elisena replied, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Helisena"/>but little do I care to know what is done or what is said, for I am near to lose all my joy and comfort.<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/></s><s>Then had Darioleta great grief, and she went apart not bearing to see her mistress weep.</s></p>

            <p><s>The tide ran strong, and soon carried the ark into the sea, which was not more than a half-league distant.</s><s>Now the dawn appeared, and it pleased God that there was a Knight of <placeName ref="#Scotland">Scotland</placeName> sailing on that sea, returning from <placeName ref="#littleBritain">the lesser Britain</placeName> to his country, with his wife, who had newly been delivered of a son called <persName ref="#Gandalin">Gandalin</persName>.</s><s>The morning was both calm and clear, whereby <persName ref="#Gandales">the Knight Gandales</persName> saw the ark floating among the waves, and he ordered the mariners to put out a boat and take it up.</s><s>They speedily overtook it, and Gandales opened the cover, and beholding the babe within he cried, <milestone unit="said" ana="start" resp="#Gandales"/>this is from no mean place!<milestone unit="said" ana="end"/> and this he said because of the rich garments, and the ring and the good sword, and he cursed the mother who had for fear abandoned so fair a child.</s><s>He carefully laid aside all the things that were contained in the ark, and desired his wife to breed up the infant, and she ordered the nurse of her own child Gandalin to suckle him.</s><s>So they went their way through the sea with a favourable time, and took port in a town in Scotland called <placeName ref="#Antalia">Antalia</placeName>, and from thence departing they came to his castle, which was one of the good ones of the land; there he had the child brought up like his own son, and such he was believed to be, because the mariners who took up the ark, had sailed away to other parts.</s></p>
